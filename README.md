# surfs_up

## Overview 
In order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop buisness is sustainable year-round, the temperatures for the months of June and December in Oahu is analyzed.

## Resources
- **SQLite database:** hawaii.sqlite<br/>
- **Python Jupyter Notebook code:** SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb<br/>
- **Resources Folder:** Query results (_Jun_Summary_Stats, Dec_Summary_Stats)_<br/>

## Results
_Temperatures in Oahu in June, and in December are beautiful. There doesn't appear to be any reason any business would not be sustainable year-round, based on temperature alone._<br/>

- Temperatures in June Average 75 degrees, and temperatures in December are just a tad cooler, with an Average of 71 degrees.
- Temperatures in June have gotten as low as 64 degree, where as in December it has gotten down to 56 degrees
- The dataset did provide more temperatures for June than December, but still feel the 1,517 days in December is a sufficent dataset for this analysis.

## Summary
Analytics of just temperatures in June and December might not be enough to truley determine the sustainability of a business in Oahu. It is also unclear what range of temperatures the shop owner expects to qualify such a thing. The temperatures in June and in December in Oahu seem lovely, but one might feel differently if it is 75 degrees with 130 mile per hour winds.
I do reccommend looking into other weather patterns, such as percipitation, and wind. Hurricans can put a damper on things for sure.
In Addition, analytics should be done for all months to get a true picture of the year-round sustainability.
