## _**Overview**_ 
In order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop buisness is sutainable year-round, the temperatures for the months of June and December in Oahu is analyzed.

## _**Results**_
_**Temperatures in Oahu in June, and in December are beautiful. There doesn't appear to be any reason any business would not be sustainable year-round.**_<br\>
- Temperatures in June Average 75 degrees, and temperatures in December are just a tad cooler, with an Average of 71 degrees.
- Temperatures in June have gotten as low as 64 degree, where as in December it has gotten down to 56 degrees
- The dataset did provide more temperatures for June than December, but still feel the 1,517 days in December is a sufficent dataset for this analysis.

## _**Summary**_
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
I do reccommend looking into other weather patterns, such as percipitation, and wind. Hurricans can put a damper on things for sure.
In Addition, analytics should be done for all months to get a true picture of the year-round sustainability.
